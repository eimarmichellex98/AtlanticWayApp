This is an app about the Great Atlantic Way. We will be using react and ajax technologies to build the app.
Within the app the user will be able to find attractions around the area using the interactive map.
They can also create a checklist to keep on top of their adventures on what they want to do or see.
We hope to have a pedometer feature that will allow the user to track their steps and see how much of the Atlantic Way they have covered.
As well as that there will be a review section where the user can write up on their experience of the Atlantic Way.
